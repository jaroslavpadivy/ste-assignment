# Objectives

1. Run the app locally.
2. Prepare test coverage (simple test cases) and add it to the source code
   as `test-plan.md`.
3. Automate as many TCs from the test coverage as you can.

### [*Not required*] Bonus points 

- Automate the entire test plan.
- Add [cypress command](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands), e.g. for setting up the test preconditions, etc.
- Use [faker-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) to fake the data in your tests.
- Use any [Cypress plugin](https://docs.cypress.io/plugins/directory), e.g. [cypress-real-events](https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/cypress-real-events)

> ### [Vue3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

- [Demo](https://vue3-realworld-example-app-mutoe.vercel.app)
- [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Vue3** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
